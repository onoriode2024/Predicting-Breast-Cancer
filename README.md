# **Breast Cancer Prediction**

I built a supervised machine learning model to predict the likelihood of breast cancer based on clinical and diagnostic features. The project involved data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines classification algorithms. I achieved high accuracy and recall, ensuring reliable identification of malignant cases. This project demonstrated practical application of ML in healthcare and emphasized the importance of explainability and performance metrics in sensitive domains.
